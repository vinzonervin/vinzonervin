Hello! I'm Ervin Vinzon. I work as a Freelance Analytics Consultant located at Manila, Philippines. I been working with data for 2 years. I started learning data analytics 2 years ago and never look back. I actively participate to many different data challenges on Twitter by Tableau Public Community and Linkedin Community to practice my skills and to learn different techniques. I also enjoy designing so apply many different UX/UI techniques within my dashboard creation.
